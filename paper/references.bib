	abstract = {Field studies are essential to reliably quantify ecological responses to global change because they are exposed to realistic climate manipulations. Yet such studies are limited in replicates, resulting in less power and, therefore, potentially unreliable effect estimates. Furthermore, while manipulative field experiments are assumed to be more powerful than non-manipulative observations, it has rarely been scrutinized using extensive data. Here, using 3847 field experiments that were designed to estimate the effect of environmental stressors on ecosystems, we systematically quantified their statistical power and magnitude (Type M) and sign (Type S) errors. Our investigations focused upon the reliability of field experiments to assess the effect of stressors on both ecosystem's response magnitude and variability. When controlling for publication bias, single experiments were underpowered to detect response magnitude (median power: 18\%–38\% depending on effect sizes). Single experiments also had much lower power to detect response variability (6\%–12\% depending on effect sizes) than response magnitude. Such underpowered studies could exaggerate estimates of response magnitude by 2–3 times (Type M errors) and variability by 4–10 times. Type S errors were comparatively rare. These observations indicate that low power, coupled with publication bias, inflates the estimates of anthropogenic impacts. Importantly, we found that meta-analyses largely mitigated the issues of low power and exaggerated effect size estimates. Rather surprisingly, manipulative experiments and non-manipulative observations had very similar results in terms of their power, Type M and S errors. Therefore, the previous assumption about the superiority of manipulative experiments in terms of power is overstated. These results call for highly powered field studies to reliably inform theory building and policymaking, via more collaboration and team science, and large-scale ecosystem facilities. Future studies also require transparent reporting and open science practices to approach reproducible and reliable empirical work and evidence synthesis.},

	abstract = {Public health guidelines for resistance training emphasize a minimal effective dose intending for individuals to engage in these behaviors long term. However, few studies have adequately examined the longitudinal time-course of strength adaptations to resistance training. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the time-course of strength development from minimal-dose resistance training in a large sample through retrospective training records from a private international exercise company. Methods: Data were available for analysis from 14,690 participants (60\% female; aged 48 ± 11 years) having undergone minimal-dose resistance training (1x/week, single sets to momentary failure of six exercises) up to 352 weeks ( 6.8 years) in length. Linear-log growth models examined strength development over time allowing random intercepts and slopes by participant. Results: All models demonstrated a robust linear-log relationship with the first derivatives (i.e., changes in strength with time) trending asymptotically such that by 1-2 years strength had practically reached a “plateau.” Sex, bodyweight, and age had minimal interaction effects. However, substantial strength gains were apparent; approximately 30–50\% gains over the first year reaching 50–60\% of baseline 6 years later. Conclusion: It is unclear if the “plateau” can be overcome through alternative approaches, or whether over the long-term strength gains differ. Considering this, our results support public health recommendations for minimal-dose resistance training for strength adaptations in adults.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-017-4209-8},
	abstract = {It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally 'aerobic' (e.g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in 'muscle strengthening activities' though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.},

	abstract = {Background
Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to result in alterations to dietary intake and non-exercise physical activity (PA). To date, the ability for resistance training (RT) to influence other health-related behaviors has not been examined. This study aimed to determine if initiation and maintenance of RT is associated with spontaneous changes in dietary quality and non-RT PA in adults with prediabetes.
Methods
Overweight/obese adults (n=170, BMI=32.9±3.8kg·m2, age=59.5±5.5years, 73\% female) with prediabetes were enrolled in the 15-month Resist Diabetes trial. Participants completed a supervised 3-month RT initiation phase followed by a 6-month maintenance phase and a 6-month no-contact phase. Participants were not encouraged to change eating or non-RT PA behaviors. At baseline, and months 3, 9, and 15, three 24-hour diet recalls were collected to evaluate dietary intake and quality, the Aerobics Institute Longitudinal Study Questionnaire was completed to evaluate non-RT PA, and body mass, body composition (DXA), and muscular strength were measured. At months 3, 9, and 15 social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs were assessed with a RT Health Beliefs Questionnaire. Mixed effects models were used to assess changes in dietary intake and non-RT PA over the 15-month study period.
Results
Energy and carbohydrate intake decreased with RT initiation and maintenance phases (baseline to month 9: β=−87.9, p=0.015 and β=−16.3, p{\textless}0.001, respectively). No change in overall dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]-2010 score: β=−0.13, p=0.722) occurred, but alterations in HEI-2010 sub-scores were detected. Maintenance of RT was accompanied by an increase in MET-min/week of total non-RT PA (month 3 to month 9: β=146.2, p=0.01), which was predicted by increased self-regulation and decreased negative outcome expectancies for RT (β=83.7, p=0.014 and β=−70.0, p=0.038, respectively).
Conclusions
Initiation and maintenance of RT may be a gateway behavior leading to improvements in other health-related behaviors. These results provide rationale for single-component lifestyle interventions as an alternative to multi-component interventions, when resources are limited.},

	abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

	abstract = {The prescription of resistance exercise often involves administering a set number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load. While this accounts for individual differences in strength, it neglects to account for differences in local muscle endurance and may result in varied responses across individuals. One way of potentially creating a more homogenous stimulus across individuals involves performing resistance exercise to volitional failure, but this has not been tested and was the purpose of the present study. Individuals completed 2 testing sessions to compare repetitions, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), muscle swelling and fatigue responses to arbitrary repetition (SET) vs. failure (FAIL) protocols using either 60\% or 30\% one-repetition maximum. Statistical analyses assessed differences in the variability between protocols. Forty-six individuals (25 females and 21 males) completed the study. There was more variability in the number of repetitions completed during FAIL when compared to SET protocols. Performing the 60\% 1RM condition to failure appeared to reduce the variability in muscle swelling (average variance: 60\%-SET = .034, 60\%-FAIL = .023) and RPE (average variance: 60\%-SET = 4.0, 60\%-FAIL = 2.5), but did not alter the variability in muscle fatigue. No differences in variability were present between the SET-30\% and FAIL-30\% protocols for any of the dependent variables. Performing resistance exercise to failure may result in a more homogenous stimulus across individuals, particularly when using moderate to high exercise loads. The prescription of resistance exercise should account for individual differences in local muscle endurance to ensure a similarly effective stimulus across individuals.Highlights There is a large variance in the number of repetitions individuals can complete even when exercising with the same relative load.Ratings of perceived exertion and muscle swelling responses become more homogenous when exercising to volitional failure as compared to using performing a set number of repetitions, particularly when moderate to higher loads are used.The prescription of exercise should take into consideration the individual's local muscle endurance as opposed to choosing an arbitrary number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load.},

Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

	abstract = {Meta-analyses are often used to estimate the relative average values of a quantitative outcome in two groups (eg, control and experimental groups). However, they may also examine the relative variability (variance) of those groups. For such comparisons, two relatively new effect size statistics, the log-transformed "variability ratio" (the ratio of two standard deviations; lnVR) and the log-transformed "coefficients of variation ratio" (the ratio of two coefficients of variation; lnCVR) are useful. In practice, lnCVR may be of most use because a treatment may affect the mean and the variance simultaneously. We propose new estimators for lnCVR and lnVR, including for when the two groups are dependent (eg, cross-over and pre-test-post-test designs). Through simulation, we evaluated the bias of these estimators and make recommendations accordingly. We use the methods to demonstrate that: (a) lifestyle interventions have a heterogenizing effect on gestational weight gain in obese women and (b) low-glycemic index (GI) diets have a homogenizing effect on glycemic control in diabetics. We also find that the degree to which dependence among samples is accounted for can impact parameters such as τ2 (ie, the between-study variance) and I2 (ie, the proportion of the total variability due to between-study variance), and even the overall effect, and associated qualitative interpretations. Meta-analytic comparison of the variability between two groups enables us to ask completely new questions and to gain fresh insights from existing datasets. We encourage researchers to take advantage of these convenient new effect size measures for the meta-analysis of variation.},

The present individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis sought to: (1) investigate the presence of interindividual differences in trainability for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), waist circumference, and body mass; and (2) examine the influence of exercise training and potential moderators on the probability that an individual will experience clinically important differences. The IPD meta-analysis combined data from 1879 participants from eight previously published randomized controlled trials. We implemented a Bayesian framework to: (1) test the hypothesis of interindividual differences in trainability by comparing variability in change scores between exercise and control using Bayes factors; and (2) compare posterior predictions of control and exercise across a range of moderators (baseline body mass index (BMI) and exercise duration, intensity, amount, mode, and adherence) to estimate the proportions of participants expected to exceed minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for all three outcomes. Bayes factors demonstrated a lack of evidence supporting a high degree of variance attributable to interindividual differences in trainability across all three outcomes. These findings indicate that interindividual variability in observed changes are likely due to measurement error and external behavioural factors, not interindividual differences in trainability. Additionally, we found that a larger proportion of exercise participants were expected to exceed MCIDs compared with controls for all three outcomes. Moderator analyses identified that larger proportions were associated with a range of factors consistent with standard exercise theory and were driven by mean changes. Practitioners should prescribe exercise interventions known to elicit large mean changes to increase the probability that individuals will experience beneficial changes in CRF, waist circumference and body mass.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis of the current literature as to the effects of interval training (IT) vs moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on measures of body composition, both on a whole-body and regional level.
METHODS: We searched English-language papers on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and sportrxiv for the following inclusion criteria: (a) randomized controlled trials that directly compared IT vs MICT body composition using a validated measure in healthy children and adults; (b) training was carried out a minimum of once per week for at least four weeks; (c) published in a peer-reviewed English language journal or on a pre-print server.
RESULTS: The main model for fat mass effects revealed a trivial standardized point estimate with high precision for the interval estimate, with moderate heterogeneity (-0.016 (95\%CI -0.07 to 0.04); I2 = 36\%). The main model for fat-free mass (FFM) effects revealed a trivial standardized point estimate with high precision for the interval estimate, with negligible heterogeneity (-0.0004 (95\%CI -0.05 to 0.05); I2 = 16\%). The GRADE summary of findings suggested high certainty for both main model effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide compelling evidence that the pattern of intensity of effort and volume during endurance exercise (i.e., IT vs MICT) has minimal influence on longitudinal changes in fat mass and FFM, which are likely to minimal anyway.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether true interindividual response differences (IIRD) exist with respect to changes in anxiety because of aerobic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia (FM).
DATA SOURCES: Data from a previous meta-analytical database of randomized controlled trials of exercise in adults with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials limited to aerobic exercise training on anxiety in adults 18 years or older with FM were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Change outcome SDs treated as point estimates for anxiety were used to calculate true IIRD from each study. In addition, treatment effect data were extracted.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The inverse variance heterogeneity model was used to pool all results. For the 5 studies and 321 participants in which results were pooled, statistically significant treatment effect reductions in anxiety were observed (mean, -0.77 points, 95\% CI, -1.25 to -0.77). However, no significant IIRD were found (mean, 0.6 points, 95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.5). The 95\% prediction interval for true IIRD in a future study was -1.7 to 0.8. The percent chance, ie, probability, of a clinically meaningful difference in variability, was 61.5\% (only possibly clinically important).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety among adults with fibromyalgia. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to support the notion that true IIRD exist. Therefore, a search for potential mediators and moderators associated with aerobic exercise and changes in anxiety among adults with FM may not be warranted. However, additional research is needed before any true level of certainty can be established. This includes (1) the assessment of IIRD in future randomized controlled trials, (2) randomized controlled trials of longer duration, and (3) an increase in the proportion of men included in randomized controlled trials.},

	abstract = {It is well established that exercise is an important component in the maintenance of good health, and yet recent studies have demonstrated that a sub-section of individuals experience no significant improvements following an exercise training intervention. Such individuals are commonly termed "non-responders". However, recently a number of researchers have taken a skeptical view as to whether exercise non-response either exists, or is clinically relevant. Here, we explore the research underpinning exercise response, to determine whether non-response to exercise actually exists. We discuss the impact of measurement error and assessment type on the identification of "non-responders", and whether such non-response is global- or modality-specific. Additionally, we discuss whether, if non-response to an exercise intervention is meaningful and relevant, certain additional interventions-in the form of increasing exercise intensity, volume, or duration-could be made in order to enhance training adaptations. Consequently, based on our interpretations of the available evidence, we suggest that it is unlikely that global non-responders to exercise exist. Furthermore, we suggest this realization effectively counters the perception that some individuals will not positively respond to exercise, and that in turn, this insight serves to encourage health professionals to create more nuanced, efficacious, and individually-focused exercise prescriptions designed to circumvent and overcome apparent non-responsiveness. Adopting a more individually-adaptive approach to exercise prescription could, subsequently, prove a powerful tool in promoting population health.},

	abstract = {Currently, little is known about the extent of interindividual variability in response to beta-alanine (BA) supplementation, nor what proportion of said variability can be attributed to external factors or to the intervention itself (intervention response). To investigate this, individual participant data on the effect of BA supplementation on a high-intensity cycling capacity test (CCT110\%) were meta-analyzed. Changes in time to exhaustion (TTE) and muscle carnosine were the primary and secondary outcomes. Multilevel distributional Bayesian models were used to estimate the mean and SD of BA and placebo group change scores. The relative sizes of group SDs were used to infer whether observed variation in change scores were due to intervention or non-intervention-related effects. Six eligible studies were identified, and individual data were obtained from four of these. Analyses showed a group effect of BA supplementation on TTE (7.7, 95\% credible interval [CrI] [1.3, 14.3] s) and muscle carnosine (18.1, 95\% CrI [14.5, 21.9] mmol/kg DM). A large intervention response variation was identified for muscle carnosine (σIR = 5.8, 95\% CrI [4.2, 7.4] mmol/kg DM) while equivalent change score SDs were shown for TTE in both the placebo (16.1, 95\% CrI [13.0, 21.3] s) and BA (15.9, 95\% CrI [13.0, 20.0] s) conditions, with the probability that SD was greater in placebo being 0.64. In conclusion, the similarity in observed change score SDs between groups for TTE indicates the source of variation is common to both groups, and therefore unrelated to the supplement itself, likely originating instead from external factors such as nutritional intake, sleep patterns, or training status.},

	abstract = {The concept of personalized nutrition and exercise prescription represents a topical and exciting progression for the discipline given the large inter-individual variability that exists in response to virtually all performance and health related interventions. Appropriate interpretation of intervention-based data from an individual or group of individuals requires practitioners and researchers to consider a range of concepts including the confounding influence of measurement error and biological variability. In addition, the means to quantify likely statistical and practical improvements are facilitated by concepts such as confidence intervals (CIs) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC). The purpose of this review is to provide accessible and applicable recommendations for practitioners and researchers that interpret, and report personalized data. To achieve this, the review is structured in three sections that progressively develop a statistical framework. Section 1 explores fundamental concepts related to measurement error and describes how typical error and CIs can be used to express uncertainty in baseline measurements. Section 2 builds upon these concepts and demonstrates how CIs can be combined with the concept of SWC to assess whether meaningful improvements occur post-intervention. Finally, section 3 introduces the concept of biological variability and discusses the subsequent challenges in identifying individual response and non-response to an intervention. Worked numerical examples and interactive Supplementary Material are incorporated to solidify concepts and assist with implementation in practice.},

	abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic for this review? We discuss the dichotomization of continuous-level physiological measurements into 'responders' and 'non-responders' when interventions/treatments are examined in robust parallel-group studies. What advances does it highlight? Sample responder counts are biased by pre-to-post within-subject variability. Sample differences in counts may be explained wholly by differences in mean response, even without individual response heterogeneity and even if test-retest measurement error informs the choice of response threshold. A less biased and more informative approach uses the SD of individual responses to estimate the chance a new person from the population of interest will be a responder.
ABSTRACT: As a follow-up to our 2015 review, we cover more issues on the topic of 'response heterogeneity', which we define as clinically important individual differences in the physiological responses to the same treatment/intervention that cannot be attributed to random within-subject variability. We highlight various pitfalls with the common practice of counting the number of 'responders', 'non-responders' and 'adverse responders' in samples that have been given certain treatments or interventions for research purposes. We focus on the classical parallel-group randomized controlled trial and assume typical good practice in trial design. We show that sample responder counts are biased because individuals differ in terms of pre-to-post within-subject random variability in the study outcome(s) and not necessarily treatment response. Ironically, sample differences in responder counts may be explained wholly by sample differences in mean response, even if there is no response heterogeneity at all. Sample comparisons of responder counts also have relatively low statistical precision. These problems do not depend on how the response threshold has been selected, e.g. on the basis of a measurement error statistic, and are not rectified fully by the use of confidence intervals for individual responses in the sample. The dichotomization of individual responses in a research sample is fraught with pitfalls. Less biased approaches for estimating the proportion of responders in a population of interest are now available. Importantly, these approaches are based on the SD for true individual responses, directly incorporating information from the control group.},

	abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? In 'personalized medicine', various plots and analyses are purported to quantify individual differences in intervention response, identify responders/non-responders and explore response moderators or mediators. What advances does it highlight? We highlight the impact of within-subject random variation, which is inevitable even with 'gold-standard' measurement tools/protocols and sometimes so substantial that it explains all apparent individual response differences. True individual response differences are quantified only by comparing the SDs of changes between intervention and comparator arms. When these SDs are similar, true individual response differences are clinically unimportant and further analysis unwarranted. Within the 'hot topic' of personalized medicine, we scrutinize common approaches for presenting and quantifying individual differences in the physiological response to an intervention. First, we explain how popular plots used to present individual differences in response are contaminated by random within-subject variation and the regression to the mean artefact. Using a simulated data set of blood pressure measurements, we show that large individual differences in physiological response can be suggested by some plots and analyses, even when the true magnitude of response is exactly the same in all individuals. Second, we present the appropriate designs and analysis approaches for quantifying the true interindividual variation in physiological response. It is imperative to include a comparator arm/condition (or derive information from a prior relevant repeatability study) to quantify true interindividual differences in response. The most important statistic is the SD of changes in the intervention arm, which should be compared with the same SD in the comparator arm or from a prior repeatability study in the same population conducted over the same duration as the particular intervention. Only if the difference between these SDs is clinically relevant is it logical to go on to explore any moderators or mediators of the intervention effect that might explain the individual response. To date, very few researchers have compared these SDs before making claims about individual differences in physiological response and their importance to personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {In the era of personalized medicine, interindividual differences in the magnitude of response to an exercise training program (subject-by-training interaction; "individual response") have received increasing scientific interest. However, standard approaches for quantification and prediction remain to be established, probably due to the specific considerations associated with interactive effects, in particular on the individual level, compared with the prevailing investigation of main effects. Regarding the quantification of subject-by-training interaction in terms of variance components, confounding sources of variability have to be considered. Clearly, measurement error limits the accuracy of response estimates and thereby contributes to variation. This problem is of particular importance for analyses on the individual level, because a low signal-to-noise ratio may not be compensated by increasing sample size (1 case). Moreover, within-subject variation in training efficacy may contribute to gross response variability. This largely unstudied source of variation may not be disclosed by comparison to a control group but calls for repeated interventions. A second critical point concerns the prediction of response. There is little doubt that exercise training response is influenced by a multitude of determinants. Moreover, indications of interaction between influencing factors of training efficacy lead to the hypothesis that optimal predictive accuracy may be attained using an interactive rather than additive approach. Taken together, aiming at conclusive inference and optimal predictive accuracy in the investigation of subject-by-training interaction entails specific requirements that are deducibly based on statistical principles but beset with many practical difficulties. Therefore, pragmatic alternatives are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with continuous outcomes usually only examine mean differences in response between trial arms. If the intervention has heterogeneous effects, then outcome variances will also differ between arms. Power of an individual trial to assess heterogeneity is lower than the power to detect the same size of main effect.
METHODS: We describe several methods for assessing differences in variance in trial arms and apply them to a single trial with individual patient data and to meta-analyses using summary data. Where individual data are available, we use regression-based methods to examine the effects of covariates on variation. We present an additional method to meta-analyze differences in variances with summary data.
RESULTS: In the single trial, there was agreement between methods, and the difference in variance was largely due to differences in prevalence of depression at baseline. In two meta-analyses, most individual trials did not show strong evidence of a difference in variance between arms, with wide confidence intervals. However, both meta-analyses showed evidence of greater variance in the control arm, and in one example, this was perhaps because mean outcome in the control arm was higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Using meta-analysis, we overcame low power of individual trials to examine differences in variance using meta-analysis. Evidence of differences in variance should be followed up to identify potential effect modifiers and explore other possible causes such as varying compliance.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges’ d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as “heterogenization” of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.},

We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (W T) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of W T by half, from +31\% under optimal conditions to +16\%, while low light increased the response to +52\%. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+19\%) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+54\%). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots {\textless}0.5 l (-36\%) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 (-18\% and -16\% respectively, data expressed on a leaf mass basis), while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust, statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO2 effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization.},

However, little is known about the sampling distribution of this effect size estimator. Here I show with a Monte Carlo simulation that the log response ratio is biased when quantifying the outcome of studies with small sample sizes, and can yield erroneous variance estimates when the scale of study parameters are near zero. Given these challenges, I derive and compare two new estimators that help correct this small-sample bias, and update guidelines and diagnostics for assessing when the response ratio is appropriate for ecological meta-analysis. These new bias-corrected estimators retain much of the original utility of the response ratio and are aimed to improve the quality and reliability of inferences with effect sizes based on the log ratio of two means.},

	abstract = {Objective: To quantify the effects of acute hypoxic exposure on exercise capacity and performance, which includes continuous and intermittent forms of exercise. Design: A systematic review was conducted with a three-level mixed effects meta-regression. The ratio of means method was used to evaluate main effects and moderators providing practical interpretations with percentage change. Data sources: A systemic search was performed using three databases (Google scholar, PubMed and SPORTDiscus). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Inclusion was restricted to investigations that assessed exercise performance (time trials (TTs), sprint and intermittent exercise tests) and capacity (time to exhaustion test, TTE) with acute hypoxic ({\textless}24 h) exposure and a normoxic comparator. Results: Eighty-two outcomes from 53 studies (N = 798) were included in this review. The results show an overall reduction in exercise performance/capacity −17.8 ± 3.9\% (95\% CI −22.8\% to −11.0\%), which was significantly moderated by −6.5 ± 0.9\% per 1000 m altitude elevation (95\% CI −8.2\% to −4.8\%) and oxygen saturation (−2.0 ± 0.4\%; 95\% CI −2.9\% to −1.2\%). TT (−16.2 ± 4.3\%; 95\% CI −22.9\% to −9\%) and TTE (−44.5 ± 6.9\%; 95\% CI −51.3\% to −36.7\%) elicited a negative effect, whilst indicating a quadratic relationship between hypoxic magnitude and both TTE and TT performance. Furthermore, exercise less than 2 min exhibited no ergolytic effect from acute hypoxia.Summary/Conclusion: This review highlights the ergolytic effect of acute hypoxic exposure, which is curvilinear for TTE and TT performance with increasing hypoxic levels, but short duration intermittent and sprint exercise seem to be unaffected.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare changes in muscle size, strength, and power between free-weight and machine-based exercises.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The online databases of Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were each searched using the following terms: "free weights" OR barbells OR dumbbells AND machines" up until September 15, 2020. A three-level random effects meta-analytic model was used to compute effect sizes.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: When strength was tested using a free-weight exercise, individuals training with free-weights gained more strength than those training with machines (ES: 0.655; [95\% CI: 0.269, 1.041]). When strength was tested a machine-based exercise incorporated as part of the machine-based training program, individuals training with machines gained more strength than those training with free-weights (ES: -0.784 [95\% CI: -1.223, -0.344]). When strength was tested using a neutral device, machines and free-weight exercises resulted in similar strength gains (ES: 0.128 [95\% CI: -0303, 0.559]). There were no differences in the change in power (ES: -0.049 [95\% CI: -0.557, 0.460]) or muscle hypertrophy (ES: -0.01 [95\% CI: -0.525, 0.545]) between exercise modes.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals looking to increase strength and power should consider the specificity of exercise, and how their strength and power will be tested and applied. Individuals looking to increase general strength and muscle mass to maintain health may choose whichever activity they prefer and are more likely to adhere to.},

A systematic research was conducted through of PubMed/MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement guidelines. A total of 52 meta-analyses were found, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2009 and 2020 and comprised 178 primary studies corresponding to 4,784 participants. Following a methodological quality analysis, nine meta-analyses were categorized as high quality, presenting values of 81–88\%. The remaining meta-analyses were rated as moderate quality, with values between 63–75\%. Based on this umbrella review, we can state that at least 10 sets per week per muscle group is optimal, that eccentric contractions seem important, very slow repetitions (≥10 s) should be avoided, and that blood flow restriction might be beneficial for some individuals. In addition, other variables as, exercise order, time of the day and type of periodization appear not to directly influence the magnitude of muscle mass gains. These findings provide valuable information for the design and configuration of the resistance training program with the aim of optimizing muscle hypertrophy.},

Sport and exercise scientists often analyze repeated-measures data, from which mean differences are reported. To aid the interpretation of these data, standardized mean differences (SMD) are commonly reported as a description of effect size. In this manuscript, we hope to alleviate some confusion. First, we provide a philosophical framework for conceptualizing SMDs; that is, by dichotomizing them into two groups: magnitude-based and signal-to-noise SMDs. Second, we describe the statistical properties of SMDs and their implications. Finally, we provide high-level recommendations for how sport and exercise scientists can thoughtfully report raw effect sizes, SMDs, or other effect sizes for their own studies. This conceptual framework provides sport and exercise scientists with the background necessary to make and justify their choice of an SMD.},

This review provides a summary of meta-analytic methods relevant to sport and exercise psychology, identifies important issues and advances in meta-analytic methods, and provides best practice guidelines for meta-analysts to consider when synthesizing research in the discipline. In Part I, I provide an overview of the basic principles of meta-analysis and direct readers to accessible, non-technical treatments of the topic. In Part II, I introduce several key issues in meta-analysis and summarize the latest advances in each: effective assessment of heterogeneity; testing for moderators; dealing with dependency; evaluating publication bias and tracking down ‘fugitive literature’; and assessing sample size in meta-analysis. I also cover two emerging topics: testing theories using meta-analysis and open science and transparency practices in meta-analysis. I conclude the discussion of each issue by providing best practice guidelines, and refer the reader to further accessible texts to augment knowledge and understanding.},

	abstract = {Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species; some (enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant-enemy and plant-mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of (negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse (but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants (suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies.},

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial meta-analysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.},

Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {The present article presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the propose model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceive self-efficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes. Possible directions for further research are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behavior), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalized belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue and depression in the future.},

This study is a descriptive-correlational research. The study population comprised of patients with breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancer treated at the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Patients’ self-efficacy and QoL were assessed using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and Strategies Used by Patients to Promote Health scale. The sample included 236 patients receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer (30.9\%), gastrointestinal (25.8\%) or breast cancers (25.4\%). The patients had little confidence in performing self-care self-efficacy during chemotherapy for the management of illness and chemotherapy-related side effects. The study found that the patients with cancer were moderately fatigued and all the domains of QoL of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy were considerably impaired. Positive correlations were found between self-efficacy scores and fatigue scores (p {\textless} 0.001), and QoL scores (p {\textless} 0.001). Better self-efficacy beliefs were associated with better QoL and lower fatigue. Improving the cancer patients’ self-confidence in performing self-care behaviours may have a positive impact on performing cognitive and behavioural fatigue management strategies and can influence positively the patients’ QoL during chemotherapy.},

Furthermore, prolonged cognitive engagement leads to mental fatigue, consisting of subjective feeling of exhaustion and decline in performance. Despite the intuitive characterization of fatigue as an increase in subjective effort perception, the effect of fatigue on effort cost has never been tested experimentally. To this end, sixty participants in 2 separate experiments underwent a forced-choice working memory task following either a fatigue-inducing (i.e. cognitive task involving working memory, conflict and switch costs) or a control manipulation. We measured fatigue in terms of subjective feeling and performance decrement and assessed effort in terms of subjective perception and task avoidance. Subjects exhibited only weak avoidance of the working memory task, with stronger influence of reward than task difficulty on their decisions. In addition, we found that task avoidance did not systematically change following the fatigue manipulation but that variations in task avoidance correlated with fatigue-induced performance decline. The other measures of fatigue and effort were unrelated to each other. Our findings suggest that subjective fatigue may develop independently of task avoidance and suggest an “anticipatory regulation” model in which fatigue urges subjects to stop in anticipation of possible, future adverse consequences.},

Using two different adaptations of a demand selection task, we show that interest can influence this effect, such that participants choose options with a higher cognitive workload. Interest was also associated with lower feelings of fatigue. In two studies, participants (N = 63 and N = 158) repeatedly made a choice between completing a difficult or easy math problem. Results show that liking math predicts choosing more difficult (vs. easy) math problems (even after controlling for perceived math skill). Two additional studies used the Academic Diligence Task (Galla et al., 2014), where high school students (N = 447 and N = 884) could toggle between a math task and playing a video game/watching videos. In these studies, we again find that math interest relates to greater proportion of time spent on the math problems. Three of these four studies also examined perceived fatigue, finding that interest relates to lower fatigue. An internal meta-analysis of the four studies finds a small but robust effect of interest on both the willingness to exert greater effort and the experience of less fatigue (despite engaging in more effort).},

	abstract = {Prior exercise has previously been shown to impair subsequent endurance performance in non-activated muscles. Declines in the neuromuscular function and altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained, sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function. Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance.},

Participants performed a modified FTT with the index finger of the dominant hand: 15 seconds ? 2, 30 seconds ? 2, and 60 seconds ? 2 with 1 minute of rest between each time trial. Rating of perceived effort at the end of task was measured by the Borg 10 scale.Exclusions:Brain metastasis, history of brain radiation, Parkinson disease, Huntington Chorea, multiple sclerosis, delirium, and depression. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to describe the relationships between BFI, FTT, and Borg 10 scale.Results:Thirty patients participated. Mean age was 56.2. Sixteen were females (53.3\%). The mean BFI mean was 4.1, median 4.4. Tapping rate did not correlate with fatigue severity. The RPE correlated with the mean BFI: r s 0.438, P = .0155. These correlations persisted after adjustment for age.Conclusion:An increased RPE in the absence of task failure suggests that the origin of CRF is central. The performance of an FTT with RPE helps to improve our understanding of fatigue in the clinical setting.},

However, competence may be expressed in two ways: as task and ego involvement (Nicholls, 1989). Seventy-eight boys (M age = 13.6 years) performed five climbing courses, and the influence of achievement goals, perceived ability, and task difficulty on effort and performance was studied. According to the achievement goal theory: (a) task-involved boys exerted more effort and performed better than ego-involved boys; and (b) exerted effort was determined by an interaction of one's achievement goal, perceived ability (PA), and task difficulty. Ego-high PA boys and task-low PA boys exerted the most effort on the moderate course; ego-low PA boys exerted least effort on the moderate and very difficult courses. Finally, task-high PA boys exerted more effort on the most difficult courses. The motivational processes underlying these findings are discussed.},

	title = {The relationship between self-efficacy and amount of mental effort invested in mathematics problem solving by adults},
	abstract = {This exploratory study hypothesized an inverted U relationship between self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) and mental effort during mathematics problem solving by adults following suggestions by Salomon (1984) and Clark (1998). It was hypothesized that both low- and high-efficacy adults would invest lower mental effort in mathematics problems. Low-efficacy adults were expected to avoid the task because of a failure expectation. High-efficacy adults were expected to use automated mathematics problem solving strategies and invest low amounts of mental effort. Medium-efficacy adults were hypothesized to invest the greatest amount of mental effort due to their belief that they would not be successful without investing mental effort to solve the problems. Subjects were 48 adult volunteers (21 males and 27 females) ages 18-25 enrolled in a university introductory psychology course. Mental effort was measured using two methods found to be effective previously: self-report and a "dual task" requirement to estimate time passing during problem solving (Cennamo, 1992). Mathematics tasks with cognitive loads of 10 were used, following Sweller (1994). Subjects were given misleading performance feedback to encourage them toward low, medium, or high self-efficacy levels. Results partially supported the hypothesis of a curvilinear, inverted U relationship between self-efficacy and mental effort. High-efficacy subjects reported significantly lower mental effort than medium- or low-efficacy subjects did. Yet the mental effort scores of low- and medium-efficacy subjects were similar, perhaps due to cultural differences affecting medium effort for Asian subjects (Mizokawa \& Ryckman, 1990). Self-efficacy was only partially affected by the feedback manipulation. Mathematics performance was significantly correlated with self-efficacy scores (r = .43). Scores for medium- and high-efficacy subjects were similar even though high-efficacy subjects invested less mental effort than medium-efficacy subjects did. This buttresses the argument that high-efficacy adults invest less effort in learning and problem solving because they have high levels of automated skills. Subjects with high mathematics task self-efficacy had significantly higher time estimation performance than low-efficacy subjects, supporting the theory that people with high self-efficacy invest low amounts of mental effort. Subjects applied the mental effort they did not need to use in the mathematics task to the time estimation task. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {PURPOSE 
        Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) has been consistently used as a subjective index of exercise intensity for both exercise testing and prescription. Little empirical efforts have been made to determine how psychological factors influence changes in RPE. This study examined the influence of self-efficacy expectations on changes in RPE as a function of exercise intensity.
        METHODS 
        Participants were 193 sedentary older adults (mean age = 66.7 years) who completed an assessment of exercise self-efficacy and aerobic capacity.
        RESULTS 
        Analyses indicated that RPE during exercise changed in both a linear and a quadratic manner as intensity increased and that self-efficacy was a predictor of both patterns of change. Those high in self-efficacy maintained a constant rate of change in RPE as exercise intensity increased, whereas less efficacious participants exhibited a slower rate of change in RPE as a function of exercise intensity, with an initial gradual curve at lower intensity and a more dramatic trajectory at higher intensity.
        CONCLUSIONS 
        Results have important implications for using RPE for exercise prescription in older adults and suggest that exercise self-efficacy is implicated in patterns of RPE change.},

	abstract = {Background The multidimensionality of the academic self-concept in terms of domain specificity has been well established in previous studies, whereas its multidimensionality in terms of motivational functions (the so-called affect-competence separation) needs further examination. Aim This study aims at exploring differential effects of enjoyment and competence beliefs on two external validity criteria in the field of mathematics. Sample Data analysed in this study were part of a large-scale longitudinal research project. Following a five-wave design, math enjoyment, math competence beliefs, math achievement, and perceived math effort expenditure measures were repeatedly collected from a cohort of 4,724 pupils in Grades 3–7. Method Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the internal factor structure of the math self-concept. Additionally, a series of nested models was tested using structural equation modelling to examine longitudinal reciprocal interrelations between math competence beliefs and math enjoyment on the one hand and math achievement and perceived math effort expenditure on the other. Results Our results showed that CFA models with separate factors for math enjoyment and math competence beliefs fit the data substantially better than models without it. Furthermore, differential relationships between both constructs and the two educational outcomes were observed. Math competence beliefs had positive effects on math achievement and negative effects on perceived math effort expenditure. Math enjoyment had (mild) positive effects on subsequent perceived effort expenditure and math competence beliefs. Conclusion This study provides further support for the affect-competence separation. Theoretical issues regarding adequate conceptualization and practical consequences for practitioners are discussed.},

	abstract = {Inter-individual cognitive factors have been shown to be related to the changes in affect evaluations during continuous high-intensity exercise in adolescents, but the role of cognitive factors on affect during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) is currently unknown. This study evaluated the influence of personality traits (behavioral activation system; BAS and behavioral inhibition system; BIS) and self-efficacy on affect, enjoyment and perceived exertion during HIIE in adolescents. Participants (n = 30; 15 boys; mean age = 12.2 ± 0.4 years; moderate to vigorous physical activity levels per day = 33 ± 12 min) were median split into low vs. high BAS/BIS and self-efficacy groups. All participants performed HIIE consisting of 8 × 1-min work-intervals at 85\% of peak power separated by 75 s recovery. Affect, enjoyment, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded 5 min before HIIE, near the end of the HIIE work intervals, and 20 min after HIIE. The high BAS/low BIS group elicited greater affect and enjoyment compared to low BAS/high BIS group during work-intervals 5–8 (all p {\textless} 0.039, all ES {\textgreater} 0.59) and after HIIE for post-enjoyment (all p {\textless} 0.038, all ES {\textgreater} 0.95). Affect and enjoyment were greater in high compared to low self-efficacy group during work-intervals 5–8 (all p {\textless} 0.048, all ES {\textgreater} 0.62). The BAS/BIS groups elicited similar RPE (all p {\textgreater} 0.10), but RPE was lower in high than low self-efficacy group at work-intervals 5–8 (all p {\textless} 0.037, ES {\textgreater} 0.98). Individual differences in personality and self-efficacy may influence the affective, enjoyment and RPE responses during HIIE in adolescents.Lay summary: This study aimed to evaluate the role of personality characteristics and self-efficacy on perceptual responses (pleasure/displeasure and enjoyment) during HIIE in youth. Individual differences in personality characteristics and self-efficacy may decrease or increase the likelihood that a person will experience pleasurable feelings and enjoyment to HIIE in youth.},

Because self-efficacy theory predicts that expectation-performance differences are maximized in the face of obstacles and aversive consequences, the experiment was rigged so that subjects lost in competition to the confederate on both trials. The results supported self-efficacy predictions with the high self-efficacy subjects extending their legs significantly longer than low self-efficacy subjects. Moreover, after failing on the first trial, high self-efficacy subjects extended their legs for a longer time than low self-efficacy subjects on the second trial. A postexperimental questionnaire revealed significant differences in cognitive states (e.g., expectations, attributions, self-talk) between high and low self-efficacy subjects, as well as between males and females.

Based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory, this study was designed to investigate (a) the effects of false information feedback on self-efficacy beliefs and subsequent weightlifting performance, and (b) whether self-efficacy or past performance is most related to subsequent weightlifting performance. Experienced weightlifters engaged in six performance sessions, each consisting of a one-repetition-maximum bench press. Male subjects (N = 36) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: accurate performance information, false information that they lifted more than their actual lift, or false information that they lifted less than their actual lift. Before each session, subjects indicated the amount of weight they were 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% confident they could lift. Results replicated existing research findings regarding deception and performance; false positive feedback increased future bench press performance. In addition, results indicated that past weightlifting performance accounted for nearly all of the variance in subsequent performance. This finding is discussed in light of the difficulty in extending the predictions of self-efficacy theory to sport settings where athletes have gained experience by undergoing repeated training trials.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a cognitive-energetical framework for the analysis of effects of stress and high workload on human performance. Following Kahneman's (1973) model, regulation of goals and actions is assumed to require the operation of a compensatory control mechanism, which allocates resources dynamically. A two-level compensatory control model provides the basis for a mechanism of resource allocation through an effort monitor, sensitive to changes in the level of regulatory activity, coupled with a supervisory controller which can implement different modes of performance-cost trade-off. Performance may be protected under stress by the recruitment of further resources, but only at the expense of increased subjective effort, and behavioural and physiological costs. Alternatively, stability can be achieved by reducing performance goals, without further costs. Predictions about patterns of latent decrement under performance protection are evaluated in relation to the human performance literature. Even where no primary task decrements may be detected, performance may show disruption of subsidiary activities or the use of less efficient strategies, as well as increased psychophysiological activation, strain, and fatigue after-effects. Finally, the paper discusses implications of the model for the assessment of work strain, with a focus on individual-level patterns of regulatory activity and coping.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, customer relationship management and loyalty programs (LPs) have been widely adopted by companies and have received a great deal of attention from marketers, consultants, and, to a lesser degree, academics. In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the ?idiosyncratic fit heuristic,? whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.},

Conversely, those who conserved strength performed better on tasks that they conserved the strength for as compared with those who did not conserve.

Moderately active, predominantly Caucasian, participants (male = 33, female = 39, M = 19.18 years, SD = .74) were recruited from the southeastern United States. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: High-efficacy (HE), low-efficacy (LE), or control. Efficacy expectations were manipulated via false performance feedback. During the task participants provided differentiated ratings of perceived effort at 15-s intervals. Effort tolerance was determined by the length of time the participant could maintain the task. Repeated measures (RM) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated the HE group found the task less strenuous and more enjoyable than the LE or control group. Furthermore, the HE group demonstrated greater tolerance of the task than either the LE or control group.

Whereas past work has focused on material and emotional costs of empathy, here, we examined whether people experience empathy as cognitively taxing and costly, leading them to avoid it. We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious. Experimentally increasing empathy efficacy eliminated empathy avoidance, suggesting that cognitive costs directly cause empathy choice. When given the choice to share others’ feelings, people act as if it is not worth the effort. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	doi = {10.3766/jaaa.23.7.7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently there has been interest in using subjective ratings as a measure of perceived effort during speech recognition in noise. Perceived effort may be an indicator of cognitive load. Thus, subjective effort ratings during speech recognition in noise may covary both with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and individual cognitive capacity.
PURPOSE: The present study investigated the relation between subjective ratings of the effort involved in listening to speech in noise, speech recognition performance, and individual working memory (WM) capacity in hearing impaired hearing aid users.
RESEARCH DESIGN: In two experiments, participants with hearing loss rated perceived effort during aided speech perception in noise. Noise type and SNR were manipulated in both experiments, and in the second experiment hearing aid compression release settings were also manipulated. Speech recognition performance was measured along with WM capacity.
STUDY SAMPLE: There were 46 participants in all with bilateral mild to moderate sloping hearing loss. In Experiment 1 there were 16 native Danish speakers (eight women and eight men) with a mean age of 63.5 yr (SD = 12.1) and average pure tone (PT) threshold of 47. 6 dB (SD = 9.8). In Experiment 2 there were 30 native Swedish speakers (19 women and 11 men) with a mean age of 70 yr (SD = 7.8) and average PT threshold of 45.8 dB (SD = 6.6).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for effort rating in both experiments. In Experiment 1, effort was rated at individually adapted SNRs while in Experiment 2 it was rated at fixed SNRs. Speech recognition in noise performance was measured using adaptive procedures in both experiments with Dantale II sentences in Experiment 1 and Hagerman sentences in Experiment 2. WM capacity was measured using a letter-monitoring task in Experiment 1 and the reading span task in Experiment 2.
RESULTS: In both experiments, there was a strong and significant relation between rated effort and SNR that was independent of individual WM capacity, whereas the relation between rated effort and noise type seemed to be influenced by individual WM capacity. Experiment 2 showed that hearing aid compression setting influenced rated effort.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjective ratings of the effort involved in speech recognition in noise reflect SNRs, and individual cognitive capacity seems to influence relative rating of noise type.},

	abstract = {To predict maximal exercise capacity, we have developed the rating of perceived capacity (RPC) scale, based on metabolic equivalents (METs). MET values from 1 to 20 were listed on a progressive scale and linked to physical activities. Test subjects rated their perceived capacity by choosing the most strenuous activity and the corresponding MET value that they could sustain for 30 min. In order to validate the RPC, 87 healthy women participated in the study (age range 21-79 years). The capacity rated from the scale (MET(RPC)) was compared with the actual work capacity in a maximal incremental ramp cycle test. The maximal load achieved at the cycle test (in W), was transformed into the unit MET (MET(test)). The mean difference between MET(RPC) and MET(test) was -1.4 (3.18) (2SD). Multiple linear regression showed that MET(test) depended significantly on MET(RPC) and age. Extended regression analysis suggested that a nonlinear correction was most appropriate in order to improve the prediction. The maximal predicted capacity was given by: MET(pred) = (5.08 + 0.70 x MET(RPC))/[1+(e(0.059 (age-87.2)))]. After this correction, the mean difference between MET(pred) and MET(test) was reduced to 0.0 (2.62) (2SD). Reference values for MET(pred) and MET(test) were also obtained. In conclusion, the RPC combined with an age correction was shown to predict accurately maximal exercise capacity; it is also quick and easy to use. Thus, RPC may be a valuable tool in the prescription of exercise and in monitoring the effects of exercise and rehabilitation.},

Across two experiments, we found that observers could predict their ability to recognize famous but not unfamiliar faces. Moreover, observers seemed to partially conflate these abilities by adjusting ability judgements for famous faces after a test of unfamiliar face recognition (Experiment 1) and vice versa (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that observers have limited insight into their ability to identify unfamiliar faces. These experiments also show that judgements of recognition abilities are malleable and can generalize across different face categories.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate how rating of perceived capacity (RPC) is related to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and examine VO2max at onset of training in healthy adults.
Methods In total, 125 newly registered fitness centre members, equally men and women, answered the RPC scale and performed a treadmill test for measurement of VO2max. Eligible criteria were {\textless}4 weeks of fitness centre membership, physically inactive, ≥18 years and not pregnant. The RPC is a one-page scale (1–20) based on metabolic equivalent tasks, where the individual chooses the most strenuous activity that can be sustained for at least 30 min.
Results The Bland-Altman plot demonstrated a tendency of overestimation, meaning that the participants ranked their own aerobic capacity 17.5\% higher than objectively measured values of VO2max. The mean difference between the two methods were +4.92±1.96 and +6.35±1.96 mL/min/kg VO2 in men and women, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was moderate, with r=0.426 (p{\textless}0.01). A linear regression analysis showed that both age and VO2max were significant predictors of RPC (p{\textless}0.01). Measured VO2max at onset of fitness centre membership was in men aged 38.7±11.7 and women aged 34.7±9.9, 40.5±7.2 and 35.0±6.0 mL/min/kg, respectively. Estimated VO2max from the RPC scale was 45.7±9.8 and 41.4±10.1 mL/min/kg in men and women, respectively.
Conclusions The RPC seems less accurate at the individual level and may overestimate VO2max. Still, it may be considered useful in large-scale studies.},

	abstract = {In resistance training, the use of predicting proximity to momentary task failure (MF, i.e., maximum effort), and repetitions in reserve scales specifically, is a growing approach to monitoring and controlling effort. However, its validity is reliant upon accuracy in the ability to predict MF which may be affected by congruence of the perception of effort compared with the actual effort required. The present study examined participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience predicting their proximity to MF in two different experiments using a deception design. Within each experiment participants performed four trials of knee extensions with single sets (i.e., bouts of repetitions) to their self-determined repetition maximum (sdRM; when they predicted they could not complete the next repetition if attempted and thus would reach MF if they did) and MF (i.e., where despite attempting to do so they could not complete the current repetition). For the first experiment (n = 14) participants used loads equal to 70\% of a one repetition maximum (1RM; i.e., the heaviest load that could be lifted for a single repetition) performed in a separate baseline session. Aiming to minimize participants between day variability in repetition performances, in the second separate experiment (n = 24) they used loads equal to 70\% of their daily isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Results suggested that participants typically under predicted the number of repetitions they could perform to MF with a meta-analytic estimate across experiments of 2.0 [95\%CIs 0.0 to 4.0]. Participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience are likely not adequately accurate at gauging effort in submaximal conditions. This suggests that perceptions of effort during resistance training task performance may not be congruent with the actual effort required. This has implications for controlling, programming, and manipulating the actual effort in resistance training and potentially on the magnitude of desired adaptations such as improvements in muscular hypertrophy and strength.},

	abstract = {Despite its apparent intuitiveness and widespread interest across various fields, ‘effort’ is a concept that seems difficult to define. The purpose of this article is to consider and define ‘effort’ during attempted task performance. In doing so I argue for distinction between the actual effort (objective effort) required, and the perception of that effort (subjective effort), during intentionally attempted task performance. I adopt a set theoretical approach to defining the intensional concepts, and extensional phenomenal constructs, and employ the tradition of Theory-Theory to illustrate tentative causal theories for and relating the concepts. The definitions I propose are deliberately agnostic of the specific task demands being attempted (e.g. physical, cognitive, self-control, or a combination) and thus reflect ‘general’ definitions of effort and its perception. Throughout, I draw upon and synthesise literature from across a multitude of disciplines, combining empirical evidence with armchair philosophising, and offer what insights I have from my own experience both as someone experiencing ‘effort’, and as a third-person observer investigating it. This work is intended to, at the very least, make my own current pretheoretical conceptualisation and understanding of ‘effort’ transparent to other researchers, and aid interpretation of subsequent empirical work, theory building, and theory testing on the topic. Further, I hope it might be useful to researchers across various fields, unify paradigms and help with integration of learnings across disciplines, and further understanding of the role of ‘effort’ and its perception from a broad scientific perspective.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

	abstract = {We discuss problems the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm poses for replication and more broadly in the biomedical and social sciences as well as how these problems remain unresolved by proposals involving modified p-value thresholds, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors. We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

	abstract = {We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods.

The article reviews frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals.

	abstract = {I propose a new model, ordered Beta regression, for continuous distributions with both lower and upper bounds, such as data arising from survey slider scales, visual analog scales, and dose–response relationships. This model employs the cut point technique popularized by ordered logit to fit a single linear model to both continuous (0,1) and degenerate [0,1] responses. The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014, European Economic Review 72, 52–75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe. The model can be fit with the R package ordbetareg to facilitate hierarchical, dynamic, and multivariate modeling.},

We also present a three-level model for the common case where, within studies, multiple effect sizes are calculated using the same sample. Whereas this approach is relatively simple and does not require imputing values for the unknown sampling covariances, it has hardly been used, and its performance has not been empirically investigated. Therefore, we set up a simulation study, showing that also in this situation, a three-level approach yields valid results: Estimates of the treatment effects and the corresponding standard errors are unbiased.},

The independence assumption is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate results with as few as 20-40 studies. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
