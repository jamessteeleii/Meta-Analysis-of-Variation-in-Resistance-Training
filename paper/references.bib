	abstract = {Field studies are essential to reliably quantify ecological responses to global change because they are exposed to realistic climate manipulations. Yet such studies are limited in replicates, resulting in less power and, therefore, potentially unreliable effect estimates. Furthermore, while manipulative field experiments are assumed to be more powerful than non-manipulative observations, it has rarely been scrutinized using extensive data. Here, using 3847 field experiments that were designed to estimate the effect of environmental stressors on ecosystems, we systematically quantified their statistical power and magnitude (Type M) and sign (Type S) errors. Our investigations focused upon the reliability of field experiments to assess the effect of stressors on both ecosystem's response magnitude and variability. When controlling for publication bias, single experiments were underpowered to detect response magnitude (median power: 18\%–38\% depending on effect sizes). Single experiments also had much lower power to detect response variability (6\%–12\% depending on effect sizes) than response magnitude. Such underpowered studies could exaggerate estimates of response magnitude by 2–3 times (Type M errors) and variability by 4–10 times. Type S errors were comparatively rare. These observations indicate that low power, coupled with publication bias, inflates the estimates of anthropogenic impacts. Importantly, we found that meta-analyses largely mitigated the issues of low power and exaggerated effect size estimates. Rather surprisingly, manipulative experiments and non-manipulative observations had very similar results in terms of their power, Type M and S errors. Therefore, the previous assumption about the superiority of manipulative experiments in terms of power is overstated. These results call for highly powered field studies to reliably inform theory building and policymaking, via more collaboration and team science, and large-scale ecosystem facilities. Future studies also require transparent reporting and open science practices to approach reproducible and reliable empirical work and evidence synthesis.},

	abstract = {Public health guidelines for resistance training emphasize a minimal effective dose intending for individuals to engage in these behaviors long term. However, few studies have adequately examined the longitudinal time-course of strength adaptations to resistance training. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the time-course of strength development from minimal-dose resistance training in a large sample through retrospective training records from a private international exercise company. Methods: Data were available for analysis from 14,690 participants (60\% female; aged 48 ± 11 years) having undergone minimal-dose resistance training (1x/week, single sets to momentary failure of six exercises) up to 352 weeks ( 6.8 years) in length. Linear-log growth models examined strength development over time allowing random intercepts and slopes by participant. Results: All models demonstrated a robust linear-log relationship with the first derivatives (i.e., changes in strength with time) trending asymptotically such that by 1-2 years strength had practically reached a “plateau.” Sex, bodyweight, and age had minimal interaction effects. However, substantial strength gains were apparent; approximately 30–50\% gains over the first year reaching 50–60\% of baseline 6 years later. Conclusion: It is unclear if the “plateau” can be overcome through alternative approaches, or whether over the long-term strength gains differ. Considering this, our results support public health recommendations for minimal-dose resistance training for strength adaptations in adults.},

	abstract = {It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally 'aerobic' (e.g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in 'muscle strengthening activities' though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.},

	abstract = {Background
Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to result in alterations to dietary intake and non-exercise physical activity (PA). To date, the ability for resistance training (RT) to influence other health-related behaviors has not been examined. This study aimed to determine if initiation and maintenance of RT is associated with spontaneous changes in dietary quality and non-RT PA in adults with prediabetes.
Methods
Overweight/obese adults (n=170, BMI=32.9±3.8kg·m2, age=59.5±5.5years, 73\% female) with prediabetes were enrolled in the 15-month Resist Diabetes trial. Participants completed a supervised 3-month RT initiation phase followed by a 6-month maintenance phase and a 6-month no-contact phase. Participants were not encouraged to change eating or non-RT PA behaviors. At baseline, and months 3, 9, and 15, three 24-hour diet recalls were collected to evaluate dietary intake and quality, the Aerobics Institute Longitudinal Study Questionnaire was completed to evaluate non-RT PA, and body mass, body composition (DXA), and muscular strength were measured. At months 3, 9, and 15 social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs were assessed with a RT Health Beliefs Questionnaire. Mixed effects models were used to assess changes in dietary intake and non-RT PA over the 15-month study period.
Results
Energy and carbohydrate intake decreased with RT initiation and maintenance phases (baseline to month 9: β=−87.9, p=0.015 and β=−16.3, p{\textless}0.001, respectively). No change in overall dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]-2010 score: β=−0.13, p=0.722) occurred, but alterations in HEI-2010 sub-scores were detected. Maintenance of RT was accompanied by an increase in MET-min/week of total non-RT PA (month 3 to month 9: β=146.2, p=0.01), which was predicted by increased self-regulation and decreased negative outcome expectancies for RT (β=83.7, p=0.014 and β=−70.0, p=0.038, respectively).
Conclusions
Initiation and maintenance of RT may be a gateway behavior leading to improvements in other health-related behaviors. These results provide rationale for single-component lifestyle interventions as an alternative to multi-component interventions, when resources are limited.},

	abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods are presented for studying “correlates of diversity”: characteristics of educational organizations which predict dispersion on the dependent variable. The conceptual framework for these methods distinguishes between variance heterogeneity that arises from educational program effects and heterogeneity that merely reflects heterogeneity of variance of inputs. The estimation theory is empirical Bayes, requiring probabilistic models both for the data and for the random dispersion parameters from each of many groups. Two strategies are considered, one based on exact distribution theory and the second based on an asymptotic normal approximation. The accuracy of the approximation is evaluated analytically and its use illustrated by an analysis of mathematics achievement data from a random sample of U.S. high schools.},

	abstract = {The prescription of resistance exercise often involves administering a set number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load. While this accounts for individual differences in strength, it neglects to account for differences in local muscle endurance and may result in varied responses across individuals. One way of potentially creating a more homogenous stimulus across individuals involves performing resistance exercise to volitional failure, but this has not been tested and was the purpose of the present study. Individuals completed 2 testing sessions to compare repetitions, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), muscle swelling and fatigue responses to arbitrary repetition (SET) vs. failure (FAIL) protocols using either 60\% or 30\% one-repetition maximum. Statistical analyses assessed differences in the variability between protocols. Forty-six individuals (25 females and 21 males) completed the study. There was more variability in the number of repetitions completed during FAIL when compared to SET protocols. Performing the 60\% 1RM condition to failure appeared to reduce the variability in muscle swelling (average variance: 60\%-SET = .034, 60\%-FAIL = .023) and RPE (average variance: 60\%-SET = 4.0, 60\%-FAIL = 2.5), but did not alter the variability in muscle fatigue. No differences in variability were present between the SET-30\% and FAIL-30\% protocols for any of the dependent variables. Performing resistance exercise to failure may result in a more homogenous stimulus across individuals, particularly when using moderate to high exercise loads. The prescription of resistance exercise should account for individual differences in local muscle endurance to ensure a similarly effective stimulus across individuals.Highlights There is a large variance in the number of repetitions individuals can complete even when exercising with the same relative load.Ratings of perceived exertion and muscle swelling responses become more homogenous when exercising to volitional failure as compared to using performing a set number of repetitions, particularly when moderate to higher loads are used.The prescription of exercise should take into consideration the individual's local muscle endurance as opposed to choosing an arbitrary number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load.},

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for performance/functional outcomes and/or body composition measurements. Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

	abstract = {Meta-analyses are often used to estimate the relative average values of a quantitative outcome in two groups (eg, control and experimental groups). However, they may also examine the relative variability (variance) of those groups. For such comparisons, two relatively new effect size statistics, the log-transformed "variability ratio" (the ratio of two standard deviations; lnVR) and the log-transformed "coefficients of variation ratio" (the ratio of two coefficients of variation; lnCVR) are useful. In practice, lnCVR may be of most use because a treatment may affect the mean and the variance simultaneously. We propose new estimators for lnCVR and lnVR, including for when the two groups are dependent (eg, cross-over and pre-test-post-test designs). Through simulation, we evaluated the bias of these estimators and make recommendations accordingly. We use the methods to demonstrate that: (a) lifestyle interventions have a heterogenizing effect on gestational weight gain in obese women and (b) low-glycemic index (GI) diets have a homogenizing effect on glycemic control in diabetics. We also find that the degree to which dependence among samples is accounted for can impact parameters such as τ2 (ie, the between-study variance) and I2 (ie, the proportion of the total variability due to between-study variance), and even the overall effect, and associated qualitative interpretations. Meta-analytic comparison of the variability between two groups enables us to ask completely new questions and to gain fresh insights from existing datasets. We encourage researchers to take advantage of these convenient new effect size measures for the meta-analysis of variation.},

The present individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis sought to: (1) investigate the presence of interindividual differences in trainability for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), waist circumference, and body mass; and (2) examine the influence of exercise training and potential moderators on the probability that an individual will experience clinically important differences. The IPD meta-analysis combined data from 1879 participants from eight previously published randomized controlled trials. We implemented a Bayesian framework to: (1) test the hypothesis of interindividual differences in trainability by comparing variability in change scores between exercise and control using Bayes factors; and (2) compare posterior predictions of control and exercise across a range of moderators (baseline body mass index (BMI) and exercise duration, intensity, amount, mode, and adherence) to estimate the proportions of participants expected to exceed minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for all three outcomes. Bayes factors demonstrated a lack of evidence supporting a high degree of variance attributable to interindividual differences in trainability across all three outcomes. These findings indicate that interindividual variability in observed changes are likely due to measurement error and external behavioural factors, not interindividual differences in trainability. Additionally, we found that a larger proportion of exercise participants were expected to exceed MCIDs compared with controls for all three outcomes. Moderator analyses identified that larger proportions were associated with a range of factors consistent with standard exercise theory and were driven by mean changes. Practitioners should prescribe exercise interventions known to elicit large mean changes to increase the probability that individuals will experience beneficial changes in CRF, waist circumference and body mass.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis of the current literature as to the effects of interval training (IT) vs moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on measures of body composition, both on a whole-body and regional level.
METHODS: We searched English-language papers on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and sportrxiv for the following inclusion criteria: (a) randomized controlled trials that directly compared IT vs MICT body composition using a validated measure in healthy children and adults; (b) training was carried out a minimum of once per week for at least four weeks; (c) published in a peer-reviewed English language journal or on a pre-print server.
RESULTS: The main model for fat mass effects revealed a trivial standardized point estimate with high precision for the interval estimate, with moderate heterogeneity (-0.016 (95\%CI -0.07 to 0.04); I2 = 36\%). The main model for fat-free mass (FFM) effects revealed a trivial standardized point estimate with high precision for the interval estimate, with negligible heterogeneity (-0.0004 (95\%CI -0.05 to 0.05); I2 = 16\%). The GRADE summary of findings suggested high certainty for both main model effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide compelling evidence that the pattern of intensity of effort and volume during endurance exercise (i.e., IT vs MICT) has minimal influence on longitudinal changes in fat mass and FFM, which are likely to minimal anyway.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether true interindividual response differences (IIRD) exist with respect to changes in anxiety because of aerobic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia (FM).
DATA SOURCES: Data from a previous meta-analytical database of randomized controlled trials of exercise in adults with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials limited to aerobic exercise training on anxiety in adults 18 years or older with FM were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Change outcome SDs treated as point estimates for anxiety were used to calculate true IIRD from each study. In addition, treatment effect data were extracted.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The inverse variance heterogeneity model was used to pool all results. For the 5 studies and 321 participants in which results were pooled, statistically significant treatment effect reductions in anxiety were observed (mean, -0.77 points, 95\% CI, -1.25 to -0.77). However, no significant IIRD were found (mean, 0.6 points, 95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.5). The 95\% prediction interval for true IIRD in a future study was -1.7 to 0.8. The percent chance, ie, probability, of a clinically meaningful difference in variability, was 61.5\% (only possibly clinically important).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety among adults with fibromyalgia. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to support the notion that true IIRD exist. Therefore, a search for potential mediators and moderators associated with aerobic exercise and changes in anxiety among adults with FM may not be warranted. However, additional research is needed before any true level of certainty can be established. This includes (1) the assessment of IIRD in future randomized controlled trials, (2) randomized controlled trials of longer duration, and (3) an increase in the proportion of men included in randomized controlled trials.},

	abstract = {It is well established that exercise is an important component in the maintenance of good health, and yet recent studies have demonstrated that a sub-section of individuals experience no significant improvements following an exercise training intervention. Such individuals are commonly termed "non-responders". However, recently a number of researchers have taken a skeptical view as to whether exercise non-response either exists, or is clinically relevant. Here, we explore the research underpinning exercise response, to determine whether non-response to exercise actually exists. We discuss the impact of measurement error and assessment type on the identification of "non-responders", and whether such non-response is global- or modality-specific. Additionally, we discuss whether, if non-response to an exercise intervention is meaningful and relevant, certain additional interventions-in the form of increasing exercise intensity, volume, or duration-could be made in order to enhance training adaptations. Consequently, based on our interpretations of the available evidence, we suggest that it is unlikely that global non-responders to exercise exist. Furthermore, we suggest this realization effectively counters the perception that some individuals will not positively respond to exercise, and that in turn, this insight serves to encourage health professionals to create more nuanced, efficacious, and individually-focused exercise prescriptions designed to circumvent and overcome apparent non-responsiveness. Adopting a more individually-adaptive approach to exercise prescription could, subsequently, prove a powerful tool in promoting population health.},

	abstract = {Currently, little is known about the extent of interindividual variability in response to beta-alanine (BA) supplementation, nor what proportion of said variability can be attributed to external factors or to the intervention itself (intervention response). To investigate this, individual participant data on the effect of BA supplementation on a high-intensity cycling capacity test (CCT110\%) were meta-analyzed. Changes in time to exhaustion (TTE) and muscle carnosine were the primary and secondary outcomes. Multilevel distributional Bayesian models were used to estimate the mean and SD of BA and placebo group change scores. The relative sizes of group SDs were used to infer whether observed variation in change scores were due to intervention or non-intervention-related effects. Six eligible studies were identified, and individual data were obtained from four of these. Analyses showed a group effect of BA supplementation on TTE (7.7, 95\% credible interval [CrI] [1.3, 14.3] s) and muscle carnosine (18.1, 95\% CrI [14.5, 21.9] mmol/kg DM). A large intervention response variation was identified for muscle carnosine (σIR = 5.8, 95\% CrI [4.2, 7.4] mmol/kg DM) while equivalent change score SDs were shown for TTE in both the placebo (16.1, 95\% CrI [13.0, 21.3] s) and BA (15.9, 95\% CrI [13.0, 20.0] s) conditions, with the probability that SD was greater in placebo being 0.64. In conclusion, the similarity in observed change score SDs between groups for TTE indicates the source of variation is common to both groups, and therefore unrelated to the supplement itself, likely originating instead from external factors such as nutritional intake, sleep patterns, or training status.},

	abstract = {The concept of personalized nutrition and exercise prescription represents a topical and exciting progression for the discipline given the large inter-individual variability that exists in response to virtually all performance and health related interventions. Appropriate interpretation of intervention-based data from an individual or group of individuals requires practitioners and researchers to consider a range of concepts including the confounding influence of measurement error and biological variability. In addition, the means to quantify likely statistical and practical improvements are facilitated by concepts such as confidence intervals (CIs) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC). The purpose of this review is to provide accessible and applicable recommendations for practitioners and researchers that interpret, and report personalized data. To achieve this, the review is structured in three sections that progressively develop a statistical framework. Section 1 explores fundamental concepts related to measurement error and describes how typical error and CIs can be used to express uncertainty in baseline measurements. Section 2 builds upon these concepts and demonstrates how CIs can be combined with the concept of SWC to assess whether meaningful improvements occur post-intervention. Finally, section 3 introduces the concept of biological variability and discusses the subsequent challenges in identifying individual response and non-response to an intervention. Worked numerical examples and interactive Supplementary Material are incorporated to solidify concepts and assist with implementation in practice.},

	abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic for this review? We discuss the dichotomization of continuous-level physiological measurements into 'responders' and 'non-responders' when interventions/treatments are examined in robust parallel-group studies. What advances does it highlight? Sample responder counts are biased by pre-to-post within-subject variability. Sample differences in counts may be explained wholly by differences in mean response, even without individual response heterogeneity and even if test-retest measurement error informs the choice of response threshold. A less biased and more informative approach uses the SD of individual responses to estimate the chance a new person from the population of interest will be a responder.
ABSTRACT: As a follow-up to our 2015 review, we cover more issues on the topic of 'response heterogeneity', which we define as clinically important individual differences in the physiological responses to the same treatment/intervention that cannot be attributed to random within-subject variability. We highlight various pitfalls with the common practice of counting the number of 'responders', 'non-responders' and 'adverse responders' in samples that have been given certain treatments or interventions for research purposes. We focus on the classical parallel-group randomized controlled trial and assume typical good practice in trial design. We show that sample responder counts are biased because individuals differ in terms of pre-to-post within-subject random variability in the study outcome(s) and not necessarily treatment response. Ironically, sample differences in responder counts may be explained wholly by sample differences in mean response, even if there is no response heterogeneity at all. Sample comparisons of responder counts also have relatively low statistical precision. These problems do not depend on how the response threshold has been selected, e.g. on the basis of a measurement error statistic, and are not rectified fully by the use of confidence intervals for individual responses in the sample. The dichotomization of individual responses in a research sample is fraught with pitfalls. Less biased approaches for estimating the proportion of responders in a population of interest are now available. Importantly, these approaches are based on the SD for true individual responses, directly incorporating information from the control group.},

	abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? In 'personalized medicine', various plots and analyses are purported to quantify individual differences in intervention response, identify responders/non-responders and explore response moderators or mediators. What advances does it highlight? We highlight the impact of within-subject random variation, which is inevitable even with 'gold-standard' measurement tools/protocols and sometimes so substantial that it explains all apparent individual response differences. True individual response differences are quantified only by comparing the SDs of changes between intervention and comparator arms. When these SDs are similar, true individual response differences are clinically unimportant and further analysis unwarranted. Within the 'hot topic' of personalized medicine, we scrutinize common approaches for presenting and quantifying individual differences in the physiological response to an intervention. First, we explain how popular plots used to present individual differences in response are contaminated by random within-subject variation and the regression to the mean artefact. Using a simulated data set of blood pressure measurements, we show that large individual differences in physiological response can be suggested by some plots and analyses, even when the true magnitude of response is exactly the same in all individuals. Second, we present the appropriate designs and analysis approaches for quantifying the true interindividual variation in physiological response. It is imperative to include a comparator arm/condition (or derive information from a prior relevant repeatability study) to quantify true interindividual differences in response. The most important statistic is the SD of changes in the intervention arm, which should be compared with the same SD in the comparator arm or from a prior repeatability study in the same population conducted over the same duration as the particular intervention. Only if the difference between these SDs is clinically relevant is it logical to go on to explore any moderators or mediators of the intervention effect that might explain the individual response. To date, very few researchers have compared these SDs before making claims about individual differences in physiological response and their importance to personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {In the era of personalized medicine, interindividual differences in the magnitude of response to an exercise training program (subject-by-training interaction; "individual response") have received increasing scientific interest. However, standard approaches for quantification and prediction remain to be established, probably due to the specific considerations associated with interactive effects, in particular on the individual level, compared with the prevailing investigation of main effects. Regarding the quantification of subject-by-training interaction in terms of variance components, confounding sources of variability have to be considered. Clearly, measurement error limits the accuracy of response estimates and thereby contributes to variation. This problem is of particular importance for analyses on the individual level, because a low signal-to-noise ratio may not be compensated by increasing sample size (1 case). Moreover, within-subject variation in training efficacy may contribute to gross response variability. This largely unstudied source of variation may not be disclosed by comparison to a control group but calls for repeated interventions. A second critical point concerns the prediction of response. There is little doubt that exercise training response is influenced by a multitude of determinants. Moreover, indications of interaction between influencing factors of training efficacy lead to the hypothesis that optimal predictive accuracy may be attained using an interactive rather than additive approach. Taken together, aiming at conclusive inference and optimal predictive accuracy in the investigation of subject-by-training interaction entails specific requirements that are deducibly based on statistical principles but beset with many practical difficulties. Therefore, pragmatic alternatives are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with continuous outcomes usually only examine mean differences in response between trial arms. If the intervention has heterogeneous effects, then outcome variances will also differ between arms. Power of an individual trial to assess heterogeneity is lower than the power to detect the same size of main effect.
METHODS: We describe several methods for assessing differences in variance in trial arms and apply them to a single trial with individual patient data and to meta-analyses using summary data. Where individual data are available, we use regression-based methods to examine the effects of covariates on variation. We present an additional method to meta-analyze differences in variances with summary data.
RESULTS: In the single trial, there was agreement between methods, and the difference in variance was largely due to differences in prevalence of depression at baseline. In two meta-analyses, most individual trials did not show strong evidence of a difference in variance between arms, with wide confidence intervals. However, both meta-analyses showed evidence of greater variance in the control arm, and in one example, this was perhaps because mean outcome in the control arm was higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Using meta-analysis, we overcame low power of individual trials to examine differences in variance using meta-analysis. Evidence of differences in variance should be followed up to identify potential effect modifiers and explore other possible causes such as varying compliance.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges’ d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as “heterogenization” of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.},

We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (W T) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of W T by half, from +31\% under optimal conditions to +16\%, while low light increased the response to +52\%. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+19\%) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+54\%). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots {\textless}0.5 l (-36\%) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 (-18\% and -16\% respectively, data expressed on a leaf mass basis), while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust, statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO2 effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization.},

However, little is known about the sampling distribution of this effect size estimator. Here I show with a Monte Carlo simulation that the log response ratio is biased when quantifying the outcome of studies with small sample sizes, and can yield erroneous variance estimates when the scale of study parameters are near zero. Given these challenges, I derive and compare two new estimators that help correct this small-sample bias, and update guidelines and diagnostics for assessing when the response ratio is appropriate for ecological meta-analysis. These new bias-corrected estimators retain much of the original utility of the response ratio and are aimed to improve the quality and reliability of inferences with effect sizes based on the log ratio of two means.},

	abstract = {Objective: To quantify the effects of acute hypoxic exposure on exercise capacity and performance, which includes continuous and intermittent forms of exercise. Design: A systematic review was conducted with a three-level mixed effects meta-regression. The ratio of means method was used to evaluate main effects and moderators providing practical interpretations with percentage change. Data sources: A systemic search was performed using three databases (Google scholar, PubMed and SPORTDiscus). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Inclusion was restricted to investigations that assessed exercise performance (time trials (TTs), sprint and intermittent exercise tests) and capacity (time to exhaustion test, TTE) with acute hypoxic ({\textless}24 h) exposure and a normoxic comparator. Results: Eighty-two outcomes from 53 studies (N = 798) were included in this review. The results show an overall reduction in exercise performance/capacity −17.8 ± 3.9\% (95\% CI −22.8\% to −11.0\%), which was significantly moderated by −6.5 ± 0.9\% per 1000 m altitude elevation (95\% CI −8.2\% to −4.8\%) and oxygen saturation (−2.0 ± 0.4\%; 95\% CI −2.9\% to −1.2\%). TT (−16.2 ± 4.3\%; 95\% CI −22.9\% to −9\%) and TTE (−44.5 ± 6.9\%; 95\% CI −51.3\% to −36.7\%) elicited a negative effect, whilst indicating a quadratic relationship between hypoxic magnitude and both TTE and TT performance. Furthermore, exercise less than 2 min exhibited no ergolytic effect from acute hypoxia.Summary/Conclusion: This review highlights the ergolytic effect of acute hypoxic exposure, which is curvilinear for TTE and TT performance with increasing hypoxic levels, but short duration intermittent and sprint exercise seem to be unaffected.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare changes in muscle size, strength, and power between free-weight and machine-based exercises.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The online databases of Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were each searched using the following terms: "free weights" OR barbells OR dumbbells AND machines" up until September 15, 2020. A three-level random effects meta-analytic model was used to compute effect sizes.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: When strength was tested using a free-weight exercise, individuals training with free-weights gained more strength than those training with machines (ES: 0.655; [95\% CI: 0.269, 1.041]). When strength was tested a machine-based exercise incorporated as part of the machine-based training program, individuals training with machines gained more strength than those training with free-weights (ES: -0.784 [95\% CI: -1.223, -0.344]). When strength was tested using a neutral device, machines and free-weight exercises resulted in similar strength gains (ES: 0.128 [95\% CI: -0303, 0.559]). There were no differences in the change in power (ES: -0.049 [95\% CI: -0.557, 0.460]) or muscle hypertrophy (ES: -0.01 [95\% CI: -0.525, 0.545]) between exercise modes.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals looking to increase strength and power should consider the specificity of exercise, and how their strength and power will be tested and applied. Individuals looking to increase general strength and muscle mass to maintain health may choose whichever activity they prefer and are more likely to adhere to.},

A systematic research was conducted through of PubMed/MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement guidelines. A total of 52 meta-analyses were found, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2009 and 2020 and comprised 178 primary studies corresponding to 4,784 participants. Following a methodological quality analysis, nine meta-analyses were categorized as high quality, presenting values of 81–88\%. The remaining meta-analyses were rated as moderate quality, with values between 63–75\%. Based on this umbrella review, we can state that at least 10 sets per week per muscle group is optimal, that eccentric contractions seem important, very slow repetitions (≥10 s) should be avoided, and that blood flow restriction might be beneficial for some individuals. In addition, other variables as, exercise order, time of the day and type of periodization appear not to directly influence the magnitude of muscle mass gains. These findings provide valuable information for the design and configuration of the resistance training program with the aim of optimizing muscle hypertrophy.},

Sport and exercise scientists often analyze repeated-measures data, from which mean differences are reported. To aid the interpretation of these data, standardized mean differences (SMD) are commonly reported as a description of effect size. In this manuscript, we hope to alleviate some confusion. First, we provide a philosophical framework for conceptualizing SMDs; that is, by dichotomizing them into two groups: magnitude-based and signal-to-noise SMDs. Second, we describe the statistical properties of SMDs and their implications. Finally, we provide high-level recommendations for how sport and exercise scientists can thoughtfully report raw effect sizes, SMDs, or other effect sizes for their own studies. This conceptual framework provides sport and exercise scientists with the background necessary to make and justify their choice of an SMD.},

This review provides a summary of meta-analytic methods relevant to sport and exercise psychology, identifies important issues and advances in meta-analytic methods, and provides best practice guidelines for meta-analysts to consider when synthesizing research in the discipline. In Part I, I provide an overview of the basic principles of meta-analysis and direct readers to accessible, non-technical treatments of the topic. In Part II, I introduce several key issues in meta-analysis and summarize the latest advances in each: effective assessment of heterogeneity; testing for moderators; dealing with dependency; evaluating publication bias and tracking down ‘fugitive literature’; and assessing sample size in meta-analysis. I also cover two emerging topics: testing theories using meta-analysis and open science and transparency practices in meta-analysis. I conclude the discussion of each issue by providing best practice guidelines, and refer the reader to further accessible texts to augment knowledge and understanding.},

	abstract = {Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species; some (enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant-enemy and plant-mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of (negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse (but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants (suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies.},

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial meta-analysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.},

Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

The independence assumption is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate results with as few as 20-40 studies. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics. In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Rapid progress requires sufficient flexibility to profit from such confrontations, and the ability to devise parsimonious but effective models, to worry selectively about model inadequacies and to employ mathematics skillfully but appropriately. The development of statistical methods at Rothamsted Experimental Station by Sir Ronald Fisher is used to illustrate these themes.},

	abstract = {A common effect size metric used to quantify the outcome of experiments for ecological meta-analysis is the response ratio (RR): the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and control group. Estimates of the variance of RR are also important for meta-analysis because they serve as weights when effect sizes are averaged and compared. The variance of an effect size is typically a function of sampling error; however, it can also be influenced by study design. Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several often-encountered experimental designs: when the treatment and control means are correlated; when multiple treatments have a common control; when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a correlated factorial design, or is multivariate. These developments are useful for improving the quality of data extracted from studies for meta-analysis and help address some of the common challenges meta-analysts face when quantifying a diversity of experimental designs with the response ratio.},

After outlining the historical context, the general principles involved in a quantitative cumulation of research findings across empirical studies is reviewed. Subsequently, recent controversies and issues surrounding the use of meta-analysis are reviewed with examples provided from the sport and exercise psychology literature. Specifically, the basis for and selection of meta-analytic models (use of fixed vs. random effects models), the treatment of data from theories that explicitly demand testing the effects of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable (use of multiple regression), and how to treat studies that contain multiple tests of a given effect (use of averaging and structural equation modeling methods) are covered. Recommendations are provided for researchers conducting meta-analytic studies based on these issues.},

	abstract = {For decades, researchers have observed that eccentric (ECC) muscle strength is greater than concentric (CON) muscle strength. However, knowledge of the ECC:CON strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the ECC:CON ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 ECC:CON ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the ECC:CON ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [CI] 1.38–1.44). The ECC:CON ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [CI 1.34–1.41]) than women (1.47 [CI 1.43–1.51]), and greater in older adults (1.62 [CI 1.57–1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [CI 1.36–1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [CI 1.38–1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [CI 1.37–1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The ECC:CON ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1°/s increase in velocity. The results show that ECC muscle strength is {\textasciitilde} 40\% greater than CON muscle strength. However, the ECC:CON ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},
